# Python

Hello Everyone! Welcome to my GitHub repo 'Python'.

## Contents of this Repo

In this repo, I will be storing all of the basic Python programs.

### 1) Dictionary

This project is a dictionary app where in if you type a word, it gives you the definition. Even if you enter a wrong word, this program can sometimes correct you in what you actually wanted to say.

The `data.json` is a file with all the words and definitions. The Python program interacts with the JSON file to get you the meaning of the word.

### 2) Rock Paper Scissor

This was a school project by Vahin and I in class 11 PCMC for our computers project.

### 3) School Programs - 11th Grade

In this folder, I have stored all the programs I did in 11th Grade PCMC.

### 4) ATM

This program is basically an ATM. You can deposit, withdraw, or check your current balance. When you download and run the program, you have to enter a PIN. The PIN is **8241** (shush...don't tell anyone).

After entering the PIN, you get options to withdraw money, deposit money, and check your balance.

### 5) Anagram

This program checks if two strings are anagrams or not.

Two strings are an anagram if they both have the same number of letters and the same letters.

### 6) Calculator

This program is a calculator. When you run the program, you get 7 options (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus, exponenciation, and floor division). You can choose which operation you want to do and enter the 2 numbers.

### 7) TicTacToe

This program is a TicTacToe game created by my classmates and I. We are still developing it.
