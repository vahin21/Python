# Python

Hello Everyone! Welcome to my GitHub repo 'Python'.

## Contents of this Repo

In this repo, I will be storing all of the basic Python programs.

### 1) School Programs - 11th Grade

In this folder, I have stored all the programs I did in 11th Grade computer science.

### 2) ATM

This program is basically an ATM. You can deposit, withdraw, or check your current balance. When you download and run the program, you have to enter a PIN. The PIN is **8241** (shush...don't tell anyone).

After entering the PIN, you get options to withdraw money, deposit money, and check your balance.

### 3) Anagram

This program checks if two strings are anagrams or not.

Two strings are an anagram if they both have the same number of letters and the same letters.

### 4) Calculator

This program is a calculator. When you run the program, you get 7 options (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus, exponenciation, and floor division). You can choose which operation you want to do and enter the 2 numbers.
