# Python

Hello Everyone! Welcome to my GitHub repo 'Python'. It's my repo for all my small Python programs.

## Contents of this Repo

These are the programs I have stored here...

### *1) Dictionary*

This project is a dictionary app where in if you type a word, it gives you the definition. Even if you enter a wrong word, this program can sometimes correct you in what you actually wanted to say.

The `data.json` is a file with all the words and definitions. The Python program interacts with the JSON file to get you the meaning of the word.

### *2) GUI - Calculator*

You should have `tk` installed if you want to run this code. Install it with the `pip install tk` command.

This is a GUI-based calculator that I had developed for my school assignment.

### *3) Rock Paper Scissor - 11th Grade Project*

This was a school project by my friend and I in class 11 PCMC for our computers project. He did the game logic while I did the front-end and configured the Flask server.

### *4) School Programs - 11th Grade*

In this folder, I have stored all the programs I did in 11th Grade PCMC.

### *5) ATM*

This program is basically an ATM. You can deposit, withdraw, or check your current balance. When you download and run the program, you have to enter a PIN. The PIN is **8241** (shush...don't tell anyone).

After entering the PIN, you get options to withdraw money, deposit money, and check your balance.

### *6) Anagram*

This program checks if two strings are anagrams or not.

Two strings are an anagram if they both have the same number of letters and the same letters.

### *7) Calculator*

This program is a calculator. When you run the program, you get 7 options (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus, exponenciation, and floor division). You can choose which operation you want to do and enter the 2 numbers.

### *8) TicTacToe*

This program is a TicTacToe game created by my classmates and I. We are still developing it.
